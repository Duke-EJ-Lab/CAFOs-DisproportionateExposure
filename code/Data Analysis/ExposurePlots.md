# Exposure plot helper functions:
we used functions func_SampleDraw.m, fundc_MA_CAFO.m, and fund_CI95.m when plot exposure distributions. 

func_SampleDraw.m create random sample data (with replacement).

func_MA_CAFO.m used moving average to smooth the exposure plots

func_CI95.m find the 5% and 95% percentile from the bootstraps.
